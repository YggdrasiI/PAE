1. Install Visual C++ 2010 Express or newer.
2. Install „Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003“ and Windows SDK, Version 7.0A(!).
   Do not use newer version of both.

Search for houres the installation files for above steps? Thanks MS... 
I would paste the download links here if I had someone.

3. Open CvGameCoreDLL/Makefile and adapt the two lines
   TOOLKIT=C:\Programme\Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit 2003
   PSDK=C:\Programme\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A

4. Open CvGameCoreDLL/CvGameCoreDLL.sln with Visual Studio
   and press F7 to start the build process.
